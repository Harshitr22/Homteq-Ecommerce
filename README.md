Hey Everyone, This is an E-commerce website called Homteq. This is a very basic website made using PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS.
This is my first website made using PHP. But It was fun making this project. The featores available are :

User - Browse through Products, Select the quantity of the products, Place an Order ( Obviously user required to SignIn or SignUp ) 
Admin - Browse through Products, Select the quantity of the products, Place an Order, Edit product details like price and quantity, 
        Process Order ( the admin can chnage the status of the products from the booking placed to Ready To Be Shipped and Delete the booking )

If you want to further progress this web-application, Here are some things you need to do:
1). Search for db.php file.
2.) Add the details to your phpMySQL account and run it. 

I personally used cyberDuck for testing purposes, which is provided by my university an tested it on their server.

Here is the link if you want to check out how it looks:
